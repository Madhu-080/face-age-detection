# 🎛️ Face Age Detection App

A simple Python application that detects faces in an image and predicts their age ranges using deep learning models built with OpenCV's DNN module. The app uses a clean Gradio interface to let you easily upload an image and see results in real-time.


## 📦 Features  

✅ Detects multiple faces in an image  
✅ Predicts age range for each face  
✅ Clean white bounding boxes and labels  
✅ User-friendly web interface via Gradio  
✅ Message when no faces detected
